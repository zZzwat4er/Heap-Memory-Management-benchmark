# Thesis: Performance Analysis of Heap Memory Management: C++ vs Java

This repository contains the code and data for the thesis "Performance Analysis of Heap Memory Management: C++ vs Java" which investigates the performance differences between explicit memory management in C++ and implicit memory management in Java.
This thesis aims to analyze and compare the performance of explicit and implicit heap memory management by developing two similar programs in C++ and Java. The performance is evaluated based on Peak Memory Usage, CPU Usage, and Benchmark Duration.

## Dependencies

To run the test, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **C++:** `g++`
- **Java:** `jdk22`


## How to Run

To run the code, execute the script provided in repository. This script compiles and runs both the C++ and Java programs with the necessary parameters.

```bash
./test.bash
```
